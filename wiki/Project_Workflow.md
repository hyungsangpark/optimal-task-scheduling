# Project Workflow

This page documents the administrative and work distribution of the project. 


## Project timeline

Before starting the project, a work breakdown structure and network diagram was used to form a Gantt chart showing the timelines and specific tasks to complete the project.

## Collaboration Methods 

* Discord and Facebook Messenger was used for online communication.
* Google Drive was used for sharing files, images and to allow for collaborative work during the Planning phase.
* Github was used for Version Control.
* JIRA Software was used for task delegation and forming the Gantt chart.

## Meetings

Meetings were mainly held in person, having approximately 3 meetings a week. Sometimes, especially in the weekends, meetings would instead be held on Discord to account for extra-curricular activities of team members. Meeting minutes and tasks completed during meetings were recorded in a separate Google Drive document.
