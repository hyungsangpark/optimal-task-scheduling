# Project Workflow

This page documents the administrative and work distribution of the project. 


## Project timeline

Before starting the project, a work breakdown structure and network diagram was used to form a Gantt chart showing the timelines and specific tasks to complete the project.

## Collaboration Methods 

* Discord and Facebook Messenger was used for online communication.
* Google Drive was used for sharing files, images and to allow for collaborative work during the Planning phase.
* Github was used for Version Control.
* JIRA Software was used for task delegation and forming the Gantt chart.

## Meetings

Meetings were mainly held in person, having approximately 3 meetings a week. Sometimes, especially in the weekends, meetings would instead be held on Discord to account for extra-curricular activities of team members. Meeting minutes and tasks completed during meetings were recorded in a separate Google Drive document.

## Workflow Distribution

### Milestone 1

The workload of Milestone 1 was separated into five main sections in which the I/O parsing, A*, and DFS implementation was carried out in parallel. These sections' tasks were delegated as follows:

* I/O parsing – Hyung
* Valid A* Implementation – Marcus, Danil
* Valid DFS Implementation – Dave, Do Hyun
* Testing – Everyone
* Report, Wiki – Everyone

### Milestone 2

The workload of Milestone 2 was separated into five main sections. Throughout this milestone, the team was open to assisting each other whenever they needed help.
  
The Optimal Algorithm Implementation and Visualisation was done in parallel. 
  
Once the optimal algorithm was implemented, parallelisation and testing of the algorithm was commenced. 
  
The Documentation and Wiki was evenly shared by everyone, each completing the wiki pages of their respective sections.
  

Each of these sections were contributed by every person at some point, but the main contributors are as follows:

* Optimal Algorithm Implementation - Danil, Dave, Marcus
* Visualisation - Hyung, Do Hyun
* Parallelisation - Marcus, Dave, Danil
* Testing - Danil, Do Hyun, Hyung
* Documentation, Wiki - Everyone
